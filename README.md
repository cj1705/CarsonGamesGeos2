# CarsonGamesGeos2
A new version of CarsonGamesGeos thats also Open Source .

I'm making a new one becuase the old version (CarsonGamesGeos/CarsonGamesGeosC) was getting too messy to the point where it was hard to add new things without old code breaking. 

This version will be mostly made up of classes that control the main form rather then having most of the code in the main form for better error handling and management.

Currently a work in progress.
